# School Project - RESTful API with MEN Stack

## Description
This project is developed as part of a school assignment to create a RESTful API using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). It is designed to be fully decoupled from the frontend, allowing for versatile integration capabilities with any frontend that can consume JSON responses.

### Features
- **RESTful API**: Implements standard REST methods to manage resources effectively.
- **Independent API**: All APIs are independent of the frontend, facilitating easy integration with various client-side technologies.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Uses callbacks and promises to handle asynchronous operations, ensuring efficient data handling and server performance.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Includes mechanisms to manage user authentication and authorization securely.
- **Data Filtering**: Multiple filters are implemented for fetching data, providing flexibility in querying database entries.
- **Image Storage**: Utilizes Multer for handling multipart/form-data for uploading images.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware are implemented for various tasks including request logging, authentication, and error handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Image Handling:** Multer
- **Authentication:** JWT/Bcrypt (assuming JWT or similar library is used)
